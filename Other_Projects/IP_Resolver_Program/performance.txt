The run time of this program is mainly determined by the dns lookup fuction. This function takes much more time to execute than the rest of the program. A way to speed up this part of the program is to have more resolver threads than less. This is why we see a speed up in trail four from trail three. Because the requester threads only have to read from a file and write to a queue, its portion of code that it must execute does not take very long. This is why there is a significant speed in trail two from trail one. Finally because the dns lookup function searches the internet, interet speeds play a role in the run time of this program.
