This is a program that simulates visiting a car dealership (not finished)

HOW TO SETUP AND RUN:

1) Open 'rasmuffinAuto.xcodeproj' in Xcode.
2) The working directory will most likely be wrong. To change it do the following: 
    --With Xcode open, go to the top bar and click on Product -> Scheme -> Edit Scheme... 
    --In the following menu on the left, make sure 'Run' is selected. 
    --Find the 'Working Directory' option and change it to the 'rasmuffinAuto' folder (Not the blue Xcode file). 
    --Close the Scheme menu. 
    --Now everything should be good for execution.
3) Click 'Run'
